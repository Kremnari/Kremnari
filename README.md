### My current projects


#### The Factory Must Grow
[TFMG](https://kremnari.github.io/TheFactoryMustGrow)\
A PWA incremental game similar to the PC game Factorio.
The player is tasked with building an ever-consuming factory

#### JSON Data-schema/Data-source
[JSON DS2](https://kremnari.github.io/jsonDS2)\
A tool for building a JSON combined data/schema data-source file.  These files can be consumed by more generic programs to generate functionality at run time
This is a precursor to...

#### ChameleonGui.is
A runtime gui generator that can consume jDS2 program files for dynamic programs.
This will initially be baked into TFMG.
