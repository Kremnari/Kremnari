### My current projects


#### The Factory Must Grow
[TFMG](https://kremnari.github.io/TheFactoryMustGrow)
[(code)](https://github.com/Kremnari/TheFactoryMustGrow)\
A PWA incremental game similar to the PC game Factorio.
The player is tasked with building an ever-consuming factory

#### JSON Data-schema/Data-source
[JSON DS2](https://kremnari.github.io/jsonDS2)
[(code)](https://github.com/Kremnari/jsonDS2)\
A tool for building a JSON combined data/schema data-source file.  These files can be consumed by more generic programs to generate functionality at run time
This is a precursor to...

#### ChameleonGUI.js
A runtime gui generator that can consume jDS2 program files for dynamic programs.
This will initially be baked into TFMG,
then becoming its own site as jDS2 compatible endpoints
start becoming available.
